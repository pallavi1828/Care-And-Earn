# Care-And-Earn
Care and Earn is a community-first web platform that connects people in need of local services (like carpentry, electrical help, carpooling, etc.) with skilled individuals looking to earn by offering those services. The project aims to empower local employment, promote freelancing, and build a reliable, tech-driven service ecosystem.
